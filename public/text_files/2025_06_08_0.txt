[Devlogs Maker] #1: Posting from the App
I can use the application as an easier way of creating a devlog, because the post doesn't have to be formatted manually.
## >> Intro

Hello everyone, I finally completed the basic features for my app "Devlogs Maker". The devlog you see here will be posted from there. I would like to think of a better name for it but it is what it is. There are definitely a few bugs to iron out, but the main features work (mostly) as expected.

I would like to go over my process for this app and planned features.

## >> Why This Idea Came To Be
I decided to make this app because I didn't want to write my devlogs on my plain text editor or in VSCode's text editor. I didn't want to manually update the date on my devlogs everytime I wanted to edit one or created a new one. I also wanted the space to look pleasant too while I typed them down. 

It would benefit me in the long run because I can automate the majority of work, and it'll encourage me to write more devlogs in a nice space.

## >> Basic Design
I would say that it wasn't too different from designing a webpage. I used several Margin Containers to act as div spacers between the Workspace and the Options Menu. I used the Tab Container for more organized separation of containers between different features. It would make use of the space and the page layout stays the same. I wanted to keep it simple overall.

Aside from the GUI, I wanted to add a theme of travel for decoration. The border attached to the Workspace is based on the envelopes for airmail, and the scrolling background is inspired by the background menu in Animal Crossing: Wild World.

## >> Too Many Features
I started out creating this app with the intention of posting devlogs to my website, and then I wanted to add more features. I wanted to make it into an app I could use daily, a more general use app. I implemented a to-do list feature in it, an in-progress theme editor, and thought about adding more to something that should be simple in the first place. I partially worked on the editor and the verification system, and then I was going to switch to add more things, like a menu switcher, etc. I realized that if I kept going, I wouldn't have the basic app completed at all.

So instead, I threw most of the features away.

## >> KISS Principle
I took out the to-do list feature, removed the majority of the buttons, and started again with my original intention of making a way to post my devlogs easier. I left the decorations on and worked on interfacing with the Github API properly through Godot. I tested the verification features and added things as I needed.

## >> Why Godot?
I know that there are plenty of other options I could have made the app in, like React Native, or Electron.

I would say... why not?

I chose Godot because it has features that allow for making HTTP requests, and creating nice GUI too. I wanted to test out those features, and I wanted to build something that wasn't a game in it. I wanted to build my app for a desktop platform and Godot provided that option to do so.

## >> Planned Features
- Auto Preview: 
I don't want to click Format Post everytime I finish typing a devlog, just to see it, and especially to post it.

- Adding Images: 
I wanted to add images to my devlogs, so I can show off my games through screenshots, or my papermaking / printmaking efforts.

- Auto Save / Save load in-app: 
In case I do something drastic, like quitting the app or something, I would like to have the words that I typed down to be saved for later editing.

- Theme Editor: 
I like that you could customize the scrolling background in Animal Crossing: Wild World when you drag the patterns into the corner. I would like to implement something like that (at least changing the theme).

## >> End
I'll write about the buttons and features on my next devlog about this app.

I'm going to put my projects up on Github, so at least you can see what I'm doing. I'm not going to edit the devlogs too much so I don't wait around to post it. I hope to add many more projects, (and devlogs!) this year. And I hope to get to finish some games that have been sitting around on my computer.

Thank you for reading, and have a good day!
