[Creating the Website] Devlog #3: Revamp the Website
I removed a page, and components now move based on the width of the screen.
## >> Short Devlog
Hello and welcome back to another devlog. I worked on the website again to change it up.

#### >> Porfolio Page Removed
Like the Artworks page, I removed it because it would look similar to the Projects page at this point. I need to continue adding many projects here before adding a separate place to feature content. I could use the Home page for that instead.

#### >> Sidebar Moved
It was on the right side, now it's on the left. I think it looks better on the left side. I would say it's easier to click links on the left rather than the right side.

#### >> Moving Components
I wanted to move the Sidebar to the middle when the browser has a small width, for example, on phones. 

Based on media queries of the browser width, I can set the Sidebar *flex-direction* to column when it's thinner, and *flex-direction* to row when it's wider. Now it should display on the phone a lot better compared to before, which felt very static.

Reading on a smaller screen should be better since the Sidebar isn't occupying horizontal space where the devlogs can go.

#### >> Text Dates
I changed the dates into this [yyyy/mm/dd/c] format instead of [yyyy/dd/mm/c] format by switching the day and month around. I also renamed the files using underscores so they're easier to read and write to.

#### >> Borders
In the Header, Footer, and Sidebar, the added borders define the separation of content more clearly. Previously, everything was floating around in space without any anchoring visuals to show what was what.

#### >> Icon
I created a simple vector graphic of a bunny with sunglasses to upload as the icon of the website. I'll be using it everywhere for now. It does make the website feel somewhat more professional.

#### >> Additional Thoughts
- Add a loading screen for moving between pages, waiting for it to resize with the content. 
- Add more visuals.
- Web app, website...

## >> End
Thanks for reading!
