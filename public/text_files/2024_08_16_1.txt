[Creating the Website] Devlog #2: Continued Progress on the Website
Website progress and overview of the rest of the sections.
## >> Hello!

Welcome back to the next devlog!

I will talk about the other sections of this website. I removed the artworks section because it's not necessary at this point in time.

Now the sections are:
1. **Home**: Where users may navigate to other pages.
2. **Portfolio**: Where I'll curate my best works and display them.
3. **Projects**: Display my newest to oldest projects.
4. **Devlogs**: Where I can provide explanation behind my ideas and works.
5. **Contact**: Provide a way to contact me.

## >> Home

The sidebar that has been present in every page is in the front and center of the homepage. It links to all other pages that exist on this website. It is now a separate component called **Mainbar**. It also has additional links to my Github account and my Itch account.

At the moment I don't have any plans to expand it. If I did then I would add a summary about myself here and more visuals.

## >> Projects

Each of the projects will have an image, name, and a short description. The image and name will link to the project page if it's hosted on Itch, or a Github repo, or to a related devlog.

The data structure of projects is different from the devlogs, the info for each project will be placed into *projects_info.txt*. For each project in order, the id, name, image name, image description, description and link is written down per line. So there are six lines that correspond to a project. Since the structure isn't variable, I just group those lines together and push the project into an array.

I wanted to have three projects per row, so I processed the separate projects further. Using the new component **ProjectMapper**, every three projects are separated into a group and pushed in their own array. When there are not enough projects to fill the row, those remaining projects are pushed in their own array. Finally, all of those groups are pushed into one central array to read from later.

These projects groups are mapped per row, and then each individual project is mapped within that row.

## >> Portfolio

The portfolio contains project components and will have additional descriptions/summaries/titles for the projects. As of now, it's essentially a copy of the Projects page except the data it draws from is in *featured_projects_info.txt*.

## >> Contact

No unique components were created for this page. I added links here to my social media accounts. I'll also leave my email here for inquiries.

## >> Additional Notes

- I could have created a component that would hold the project data and separate them, and then distribute them as needed to both the Projects and Portfolio page. Then I would get the projects by id instead rather than storing them in an array. This would be more useful for the Portfolio page and separating projects by categories. For now, keeping the website simple is fine.

- Image folder is created. I need to consider the amount of storage space used on the repo.

- Links are now included in the footer of every page.

- I should establish a proper style for the website rather than keeping it minimalistic.

- NavLink from react-router could be used for the sidebar.

- Added the workaround for redirects.

## >> End

I'll implement more components when neccessary. If there're too many devlogs to list in a reasonable length, then I'll add more pages to accommodate them. I'll also start writing about my other projects aside from this website.

Thank you for reading.
